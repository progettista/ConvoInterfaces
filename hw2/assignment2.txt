Assignment 2. Due Friday, February 3, 6pm.

1. Stateful chatbots (60%)
In the previous homework you chatbots were stateless: there was no memory about what happened in the previous interaction turns. In this homework you will improve your chatbots with by implementing a finite state machine model of dialogue.
Study the code fsm.html and answer the following questions:

1.1 What is the shortest possible conversation, in number of dialogue turns? (10%)
	2

1.2 What is the longest possible conversation? (10%)
	4

1.3 Choose a task domain for your task-oriented chatbot. Design a flow chart of the interaction. State and discuss the design principles behind your interaction design. (20%)
	Domain: 
	Flow chart: see “fsm-task.jpg”
	Design principles: 

1.4 Implement the flow chart in code, by modifying fsm.html into fsm-task.html (20%).
	See fsm-task.html

1.5 Design a flow-chart for a non-task oriented version of your chatbot. State and discuss the design principles behind your interaction design. (20%)
	Domain: 
	Flow chart: see “fsm-nontask.jpg”
	Design principles: 

1.6 Implement the flow chart in the code, by modifying fsm.html into fsm-nontask.html. (20%)
	See fsm-nontask.html

2. Reading: Read the following paper about grounding in communication with children (40%)
http://web.stanford.edu/~clark/2010s/Clark,%20H.H.%20_How%20to%20talk%20with%20children_.2014.pdf
Write an answer to the following questions:

2.1 What are different ways people adapt their speech to different audiences?
	People adapt their speech to different audiences in three ways:
    (1) talking for others: speech is directed at a particular class of people
    (2) talking to others: speech tailored to an individual person
    (3) talking with others: speech that evolves collaboratively

2.2 What are different ways adults and children achieve grounding in the communication?
	

2.3 How could you incorporate some of the knowledge into your chatbots from the part 1 of the homework?
